This is the 23_GNUT_PPP directory, where you will find scripts for: 

A) sug_bertiss_gg.sh - copying TropNET GNSS tropospheric files (/home/x04/suada/GPSDATA/MET_BCKP/CAMP/$YYYY/$DOY/ATM/) to tmp directory and uploding the ZTDs in the SUADA GNSS_IN table

B) sug_gnss_nrt_iwv.sh - computes IWV by combining the data from SUADA tables GNSS_IN (SOURCE=22) and NWP_IN_1D (SOURCE=73).  To do this first the matching station coordinates are checked and then the IWV is computed station by station in a matlab program sug_nrt_iwv.m.  The output is copied to BINCA ftp directory: /work/mg/suada5/Bernese52/HSA/rinex/BINCA/GNSS/  

1. Check if data is already available in the SUADA. Start the database using:

> mysql --local-infile -u meteo -pm3t30d4t4 -h fs002

Then use following command in the MySQL terminal:

> use suada_5;
> select count(*) from GNSS_IN where SensorID in (select ID from SENSOR where SourceID=22) and Datetime between 'YYYY-MM-DD' and 'YYYY-MM-DD';

2. Start the calculation using:

> ./sug_post.sh
